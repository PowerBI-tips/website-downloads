## PowerBI tips Icons V2
With the announcement of the Power BI Desktop release of July 2019 we now have a new feature, Icon Sets.  We are please to announce that fellow [MVP Reid Havens](https://www.linkedin.com/in/reidhavens/), from Havens Consulting has worked on some additional icons for you to use.  This brings our Icon list up to 50 Icons.  

Additional Icons Provided by [Havens Consulting](https://www.havensconsulting.net/).  

For more information on Icon Sets read the following [tutorial on how to use them](https://powerbi.tips/2019/07/icons-upon-icons/).

## Report Features Template
This layout deviates from our traditional layout style.  This layout contains the starter "Instructions" page for the report consumer.  Often when we have developed reports for individuals there are a number of new users consuming the report.  With all the wonderful reporting features new users tend to struggle.  They don't know which buttons to press, or are unaware of report feature that you have designed.  This starter PBIT file enables you to quickly develop reports without the need to teach all your end users how the report works.

All linked videos are designed to aid with training the end user how to use your report features.  Check out this new layout and use it in your new reporting projects.
